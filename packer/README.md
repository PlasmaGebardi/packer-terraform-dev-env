# Packer stuff

As the name suggests, this folder contains all the stuff related to packer, which is another great tool from Hashicorp that makes my/our life a lot easier.

Shortly it will create a machine image based on your instructions and the process can be repeated and modified without worries of braking.

* Basic folder has superduper plain basis that you can start modifying
* Factorio config is just for example (and for running factorio server of course), but can be easily modified to any number of different configurations.
* Scripts folder contains useful scripts that can be used during/after image building
